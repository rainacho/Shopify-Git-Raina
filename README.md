  ðŸ‘‰ If the email input does not validate, an error message should be rendered below the field.<br> 
  ðŸ‘‰ If the email input is valid, the form should submit without reloading or navigating away from the page.<br> 
  ðŸ‘‰ The value of each field should be logged in the browser console.<br> 
  ðŸ‘‰ It should show a loading state for 2 seconds, to simulate an HTTP request.<br> 
  ðŸ‘‰ It should allow only a single submission. (Subsequent attempts to submit should be ignored after the initial submission)<br> 
  ðŸ‘‰ After the simulated request, a "thank you" message should replace the form without refreshing the page.<br>
